Basic Image proccesing Algorithm for segmenting the blood vessels in the retina using the threshold method.

Requires:
- That you manually decide on the threshold.

This program requires a mask image and a ground truth image to calculate the quality of the segmentation (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity). It is therefore not a good candidate for creating an automated segmentation algorithm.
